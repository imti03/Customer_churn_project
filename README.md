Customer Churn Prediction Project
Telecom Customer Churn

Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical business metric that measures the rate at which customers leave or stop using a service. Predicting churn can help telecom companies identify and retain at-risk customers, ultimately reducing revenue loss.

The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and is available here. In this README, we will provide an overview of the project, its objectives, and how to use the notebook.

Objectives
Data Exploration: Explore the telecom customer data to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that influence customer churn.
Model Building: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Deployment: If applicable, deploy the model for real-time customer churn prediction.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about telecom customers, including various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not. You can find the dataset in the data directory of this repository.

Getting Started
To run the project and explore the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/imti03/Customer_churn_project.git
Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already. You can use pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook Telecom customer churn project.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.

Follow the instructions and code provided in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

Dependencies
The project uses various Python libraries and packages, including but not limited to:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
You can find the complete list of dependencies and their versions in the requirements.txt file.

Results
The project's results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, are presented within the Jupyter Notebook. You can review these results to understand the effectiveness of the machine learning models in predicting customer churn.

Conclusion
Customer churn prediction is a valuable task for telecom companies to retain their customers and improve business profitability. This project provides insights into how machine learning can be applied to address this challenge.
